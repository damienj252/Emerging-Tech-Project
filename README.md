# Emerging-Tech-Project
This project is part of my final year project for the Emerging Technologies Module

# Overview 
 This project uses a web application in python to recgonise images. The users will will be able to do this through their 
 web browser such as chrome. The application will allow the user to draw a number on a canvas and the application will
 respond to the digit contained in the image. 

# Technologies 
Tensorflow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional 
data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one 
or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed
by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence 
research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research
but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. 
It is BSD licensed. The latest stable version of Flask is 0.12.2 as of May 2017. 
Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn, and the community web page for Flask itself. 
Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. 
It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries
provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were 
implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling,
various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated 
far more regularly than the core Flask program.

The famous MNIST data set. The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set 
of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits
have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
